\citet{nicolau2015guidelines} analysed symbolic regression datasets presented by \citet{mcdermott2012genetic}, comparing different aspects of these benchmarks. They focused on synthetically generated datasets, 
%---the data is generated by applying a given function to a set of predefined input points---
exploring the sampling strategy and size and the addition of artificial noise to the data. The authors compared GP and Grammatical Evolution (GE) to two particularly simple baselines---a constant, corresponding to the average response observed in the training set and a linear regression model. Results highlight a correlation between the distribution of the response variable and the performance of evolutionary algorithms. For datasets with response variable with high variance, models induced by linear regression or by constant values were as good as or better than the ones induced by GP and GE.

\citet{dick2015reexamination} presents a quantitative analysis of the Human Oral Bioavailability dataset, used to guide de development of different GP-based methods. The authors analyse the features---investigating type, correlation and importance according with information gain, random forest and variable importance---sampling variance and the performance of GP,

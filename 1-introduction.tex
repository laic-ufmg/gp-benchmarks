\section{Introduction}

The quest for better Genetic Programming (GP) based algorithms---by overcoming known drawbacks, proposing new paradigms or hybridizing existing ones---is as important as the search for better ways of evaluating these methods and comparing them under different aspects. It is necessary to consistently and efficiently identify the scenarios where the new algorithm excels and how it compares to its predecessors.
